## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find or notice any security vulnerability in Fensak software, you can
report the finding to the team at:

    security@fensak.io

We will review the potential threat and work towards issuing a fix based on the
level of risk associated with the vulnerability. During this time, we may follow
up with additional information or guidance. Once a proper assessment has been
made, we will provide a detailed response indicating the next steps in handling
your report, and endeavor to keep you infomred of the progress towards a fix and
full announcement.

Thank you for your help in improving the security of our open source software!
We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort
to acknowledge your contributions.

> **NOTE**

> We currently do not have a bug bounty program and will not offer bounties on reported security vulnerabilities.
